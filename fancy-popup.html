	<p>Many of Montreal’s most famous buildings (Windsor Station, Notre-Dame Basilica, and the Redpath Museum) are constructed with a very distinct looking limestone commonly referred to as Montreal greystone. Formed millions of years ago near the surface on the eastern end of the island, it was the material of choice for the city’s early property developers.<br />

	<p>When Jacques Cartier visited the Mohawk Iroquois village of Hochelaga (future site of Montreal), he wrote in his journal that the village was “encompassed by cornfields.” Most of the villagers’ activities revolved around the planting, care, harvesting and storing of corn. They were so apt at the growing corn that eventually male members of the tribe were able to spend more time training as warriors and hunters as opposed to working in the fields. The Iroquois nation thus became a powerful force during the 17th and 18th Centuries. This grindstone was found at Lanoraie, about 60 kilometres downriver from Montreal and was one of many tools used during corn production.</p>
